<p>During this coronavirus outbreak, the safest way to get medical care is over the phone or online. This is called “telehealth” or “telemedicine.”  Telehealth is also the best way to get most other medical care (including other symptoms, mental health care, or ongoing conditions) during the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/#top">Stay Home Order</a>.  Many doctors and insurance companies offer telehealth options for COVID-19 screening. </p>



<p>The simplest way to get treated over the phone is to call your doctor. If this isn’t an option (for instance, you don’t have a doctor, your doctor is too busy, or your doctor can’t treat you over the phone), your insurance company may offer other telehealth options. Nurse lines, insurance patient portals (websites), and video consultation are several common kinds of telehealth.</p>



<p>California and the federal government have<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/17/california-requests-federal-government-waiver-to-cover-medi-cal-recipients-and-expand-tele-health-options/"> implemented changes</a> that make it easier for physicians and patients to use telehealth to interact with their patients during this crisis.&nbsp; </p>
