		<h3>Help prevent community spread</h3>
		<p>Older adults and people with serious medical conditions are most at risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. People can spread the disease even if they never develop symptoms, so the best way to protect your community is to stay healthy and be careful. Here’s how everyone can help:</p>
		
		 <ol class="list-group list-group-flush">
			 <li class="list-group-item">Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
			 <li class="list-group-item">Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
			 <li class="list-group-item">Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
			 <li class="list-group-item">Avoid contact with people who are sick, and stay home if you feel sick.</li>
			 <li class="list-group-item">Cough or sneeze into a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
			 <li class="list-group-item">Avoid large gatherings and follow guidance from local public health officials. For the latest, <a href="https://www.alpha.ca.gov/sign-up-for-local-emergency-alerts/" target="_self">sign up for local emergency alerts</a>.</li>

		<h3>How is California responding?</h3>
			
		<p>On March 4, 2020, Governor Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/04/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-to-help-state-prepare-for-broader-spread-of-covid-19/" target="_self">declared a State of Emergency</a> to help the state prepare for broader spread of COVID-19. On March 12, 2020, Governor Newsom issued an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/12/governor-newsom-issues-new-executive-order-further-enhancing-state-and-local-governments-ability-to-respond-to-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_self">Executive Order in response to the continuing spread of COVID-19</a>. This executive order:</p>	
			
			<ul>
				<li>Directs Californians to follow public health directives including canceling large gatherings of more than 250 people</li>
				<li>Removes waiting period for unemployment and disability insurance for Californians who lose work as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak</li>
				<li>Readies state to commandeer hotels & medical facilities to isolate & treat COVID-19 patients</li>
				<li>Allows local and state legislative bodies to hold meetings via conference calls while still meeting state transparency requirements</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>All levels of state government are being deployed to tackle the evolving situation:</h3>
			<p>The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is monitoring the disease across the state and publishing data regularly. <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx" target="_self">See CDPH press releases for the latest news and data</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency provides <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/covid19_guidelines.pdf" target="_self">guidance for homeless providers and shelters (pdf)</a>.
				
			<p>Eighteen public health labs in California are testing for COVID-19, and soon even more will be. This means getting test results sooner, so patients get the best care.</p>
			
			<h3>The State is working to ensure all have access to healthcare:</h3>
			<h4>Healthcare Options for Uninsured Individuals</h4>
			<p>If you do not have a source of health care coverage or have recently lost your employer-sponsored health care coverage, here are some options you can explore:</p>

			 <ol class="list-group list-group-flush">
				 <li class="list-group-item"><span class="bold">Covered CA:</span> Check out the <a href="http://www.coveredca.com" target="_self">Covered California website</a> or call <a href="tel:18552952023">1-855-295-2023</a> to find a healthcare program that works for you.</li>
				 <li class="list-group-item"><span class="bold">Medi-Cal:</span> See if you qualify for <a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/eligibility/Pages/HospitalPE.aspx" target="_self">Hospital Presumptive Eligibility</a> (HPE). The HPE Program provides qualified individuals with immediate access to temporary, no-cost Medi-Cal while applying for permanent Medi-Cal coverage <span class="bold">or other health coverage</span>.</li>
			</ol>
				 <p class="pt-3">Review healthcare coverage options and contact the specific programs for more information. </p>
			<h4>Cost Sharing Waivers for Individuals with Health Insurance </h4>
			<p>The Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) and the California Department of Insurance (DOI) are taking action to ensure that cost does not prevent access to medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19. It has directed all full-service commercial and Medi-Cal plans to immediately reduce cost-sharing (including, but not limited to, co-pays, deductibles, or coinsurance) to zero for all medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19. </p>
