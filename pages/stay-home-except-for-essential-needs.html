<p>The California State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health is <strong>ordering all individuals living in the State of California to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to follow the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors">federal critical infrastructure sectors</a></strong>.</p>



<h2>What to do</h2>



<p>The State of California is requiring people to stay home except for essential needs.</p>



<p>Vulnerable populations must stay home. Everyone else is required to stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is OK to go outside for walks or bike rides if you are not in a group.</p>



<p>Stay at least 6&nbsp;feet apart when leaving your home for essential activities.</p>



<p>It may be extended depending on recommendations from public health officials.</p>



<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>



<p>This is a critical intervention to reduce harm from the spread of the coronavirus in our community. This is a mandatory order.</p>



<p>Now is the time to do everything we can to prevent the situation from getting much worse in a matter of days or weeks. Every hour counts. We need and appreciate the cooperation of everyone who lives and works in California to act immediately.</p>



<p>While this news may feel alarming, it is a necessary step to prevent a worsening situation. The patterns of the virus around the world, and in our own state, tell us that moving right now to maximize social distancing and restrict people gathering is the best way to fight the virus and save lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If everyone works together, we should be able to adjust to the new rules over the next few weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that there will be a lot of questions and concerns at the beginning of this new regimen. This is a major change being taken to protect public health. Please be patient and kind to one another.&nbsp;Together, we will get through this, and our community’s health will be protected.</p>



<h3>How long will we stay home?</h3>



<p>This goes into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020.</p>

<h3>Is this mandatory or is it just guidance?</h3>



<p>It is mandatory. This Order is a legal Order issued under the authority of California law. You are required to comply, and it is a misdemeanor crime not to follow the order (although the intent is not for anyone to get into trouble).&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is critical for everyone to follow the Order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect themselves, their loved ones, friends, neighbors and the whole community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reduce the time you are around others outside the home, even when at least 6 feet away.</p>

<p>You can go to the store to buy food for yourself, for those in your home, and for anyone else that needs help. This also includes medical supplies at a pharmacy and essential home maintenance supplies at a hardware store.</p>



<p>Businesses selling those items can remain open. Employees of those businesses can keep working to ensure those businesses are operating.</p>

<h4>Online stores and delivery</h4>



<p>Mail and other delivery services to your home can continue to function, as can food delivery services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every time you make a trip, respect 6 feet of social distancing.</p>



<p>Holding group viewings, wakes, or memorial services is not permitted.</p>



<p>Order delivery whenever possible.</p>



<h3>Pets</h3>

<h4>Routine, elective or non-urgent health needs</h4>



<p>Non-essential medical care like eye exams, teeth cleaning, and elective procedures must be cancelled or rescheduled. If possible, health care visits should be done remotely.</p>



<p>Contact your health care provider to see what services they are providing.</p>



<p>If you are feeling sick, please first call your doctor, a nurse hotline, or an urgent care center.</p>



<h4>Prescriptions and pharmacy trips</h4>



<p>Drug stores and other medical supply stores are allowed to operate. When possible, have the drug store deliver your prescription medicine to your home.</p>



<h4>Getting to my doctor or hospital</h4>



<p>If possible, walk or drive yourself to healthcare. If someone else in your home is sick and can drop you off, that is another good option. Try to avoid exposing others to any germs you have, especially if you are seriously ill.</p>



<p>If you have Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like a surgical mask or N-95 mask, wear that to prevent exposing others. If you don’t have that, you could use a temporary method such as wrapping a clean scarf around your mouth and nose to try to reduce droplets when you cough and sneeze.</p>



<p>Although this is not an approved method, it is something you can do to avoid exposing others.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Therapy, massage, and medical cannabis</h4>



<p>You can go if your health care provider decides these services are essential for your health.</p>



<p>Under&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/files/Order-C19-08-ProhibitingElectiveSurgery.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a health order issued March 18</a>, any routine appointments or elective procedures should be postponed.</p>



<p>Anything that can be done remotely — by phone or online — should be.</p>



<p>If it’s essential, your provider should screen you by phone for coronavirus symptoms before you leave home. If you go, use social distancing and personal protective equipment during the visit.</p>



<p>If&nbsp;you need a prescription, have it delivered to your home if possible. This includes medical cannabis.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Health care settings</h3>



<h4>Visiting hospitals, nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities or residential care</h4>



<p>Most visitors are not allowed in health care settings.</p>



<p>There are limited exceptions, such as if you are going to the hospital with a minor who is under 18 years old or someone who is developmentally disabled and needs assistance.</p>



<p>For most other situations, other existing Orders of the Health Officer addressing this emergency prohibit non-necessary visitation to these kinds of facilities. If you need to know more, please contact the facility you want to visit by phone before you leave.</p>
