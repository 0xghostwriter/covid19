<h3><strong>Business and taxes</strong></h3>



<p><strong>What businesses and organizations are exempt?</strong></p>



<p>Businesses and organizations that provide critical infrastructure for the state are exempted, including health care and public health, public safety, food and agriculture and media. See the <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/img/EssentialCriticalInfrastructureWorkers.pdf">full list of exempt sectors (pdf)</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>I work at an exempted business or organization, as defined by the Order.&nbsp;Do I need to get an official letter of authorization from the state to operate?</strong></p>



<p>No.&nbsp;If your business or organization is in the list of exempt sectors, it may still operate. You do not need to obtain any specific authorization from the&nbsp;state to do so.</p>

<h3><strong>Schools and childcare</strong></h3>



<p><strong>My school is providing free grab-and-go meals and childcare. Are those still open?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. It is essential to keep children fed and educated. School employees should report to work if needed to provide on distance learning, school meals, and childcare/supervision.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/schooldirectory">Check your local school district</a>&nbsp;for more information on how and where to receive services, including school meals.</p>



<p><strong>Are daycares still open? Can my babysitter still come to the house?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, depending on your job. Daycares are still open, but only for children of parents working in <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/img/EssentialCriticalInfrastructureWorkers.pdf">essential sectors (pdf)</a>. Daycare centers that remain open should use heightened cleaning and distancing requirements.</p>



<p>Babysitters may also come to the house to care for minors of parents working in essential sectors.</p>



<h3><strong>Health care and helping sick relatives</strong></h3>



<p><strong>What if I need to visit a health care provider?</strong></p>



<p>If you are feeling sick with flu-like symptoms, please first call your doctor, a nurse hotline, or an urgent care center.</p>



<p>If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator the exact symptoms you are experiencing so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</p>



<p><strong>What about routine, elective, or non-urgent medical appointments?</strong></p>



<p>Non-essential medical care like eye exams, teeth cleaning, and elective procedures should be cancelled or rescheduled. If possible, health care should be done remotely.</p>



<p>Contact your health care provider to see what services they are offering.</p>



<p><strong>May I still go out to get my prescriptions?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. You may leave your home to obtain prescriptions or get cannabis from dispensaries with medical permits.</p>



<p><strong>Can I leave home to care for my elderly parents or friends who require assistance to care for themselves? Or a friend or family member who has disabilities?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. Protect them and yourself by following social distancing guidelines such as washing hands before and after, using hand sanitizer, maintaining at least six feet of distance when possible, and coughing or sneezing into your elbow or a tissue and then washing your hands. If you have early signs of a cold, please stay away from your older loved ones.</p>



<p><strong>Can I visit loved ones in the hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing facility, or other residential care facility?</strong></p>



<p>Generally no. There are limited exceptions, such as if you are going to the hospital with a minor who is under 18 or someone who is developmentally disabled and needs assistance. For most other situations, the order prohibits non-necessary visitation to these kinds of facilities except at the end-of-life. This is difficult, but necessary to protect hospital staff and other patients.</p>



<h3><strong>Outdoor recreation</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Can I still exercise? Take my kids to the park for fresh air? Take a walk around the block? Walk my dog?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. So long as you are maintaining a safe social distance of six feet from people who aren’t part of your household, it is ok to go outside for exercise, a walk, or fresh air. Gyms are closed.</p>



<p><strong>Can I go hiking?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, you may still go outside so long as you stay six feet from other hikers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Are State Parks open?</strong></p>



<p>California State Parks have closed indoor facilities and campgrounds, but trails and outdoor spaces are still open.&nbsp;Spending time outdoors can lead to a number of overall health and wellness benefits like lessening anxiety, boosting creativity and getting your vitamin D.&nbsp;If you decide to make a trip, remember to keep social distance.</p>
