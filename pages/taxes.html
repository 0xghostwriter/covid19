<h2 id="questions-taxes">Questions and answers about taxes</h2>



<p><strong>Is the deadline for filing California tax returns extended?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Yes. All California taxpayers (individuals and businesses) can file and pay by July 15, 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/about-ftb/newsroom/news-releases/2020-3-state-postpones-tax-deadlines-until-july-15-due-to-the-covid-19-pandemic.html">information from the CA Franchise Tax Board</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>



<p><strong>Has the deadline for federal taxes changed? </strong></p>



<p>The federal deadline for&nbsp;<strong>paying</strong>&nbsp;taxes has been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/payment-deadline-extended-to-july-15-2020">extended to July 15, 2020</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus">information on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>



<p><strong>What about county property taxes? Has that deadline changed?</strong></p>



<p>Check with your county for updates.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any tax deductions for people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak?</strong></p>



<p>No. Check with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus">U.S. Internal Revenue Service</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/">California Franchise Tax Board</a>, and your local government for updates.</p>



<h2>Questions and answers on interest-free loans for small businesses</h2>



<p><strong>What do taxpayers need to do if they want to take advantage of relief from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration?</strong></p>



<p>Interested taxpayers should contact CDTFA by visiting cdtfa.ca.gov or calling 800-400-7115. </p>



<p><strong>When will taxpayers start on these payment plans?</strong></p>



<p>Given that the April deadline to file and pay sales and use tax returns has been extended to late July for all but the largest taxpayers, CDTFA expects that most participating taxpayers will begin their payment arrangements in late July of this year.  </p>



<p><strong>How will the payment plans work?</strong></p>



<p>Qualifying sales and use taxpayers with deferred liabilities up to $50,000 will pay their tax due in 12 equal monthly installments.  No interest or penalties will be assessed against the liability.</p>



<p><strong>Is this only for tax payments due for the 1st quarter of 2020? </strong></p>



<p>If taxpayers choose to use this program to distribute the burden of their May or June prepayments or their July return, CDTFA will work to accommodate those taxpayers.</p>



<p><strong>What if taxpayers owe more than the $50,000 limit on the relief?</strong></p>



<p>The maximum amount that any taxpayer can defer interest-free under this relief effort is $50,000.</p>



<p><strong>What if taxpayers with more than $5 million in annual taxable sales need this relief?</strong></p>



<p>We recognize that some taxpayers, particularly in low margin businesses, with annual taxable sales over $5 million may also need this relief. Those taxpayers are encouraged to reach out to CDTFA, which will work with them to provide relief where appropriate.  </p>
