<h3 id="been-exposed"><b>If you’ve been exposed or have symptoms</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay at home for <strong>7 days</strong> if:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You feel like you have a fever</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a new cough </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have traveled to an </span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">area of concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the last 14 days</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have had close contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is </span><b>not</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helpful to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wear a face mask if you aren’t sick and aren’t in a healthcare setting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the doctor if you’re able to manage symptoms at home</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stockpile masks or gloves, which are needed by healthcare providers</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="higher-risk"><b>If you’re at higher risk of illness</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older adults and people with compromised immune systems or serious chronic medical conditions are at higher risk of getting very sick from this new coronavirus. If you or someone you’re close to is at higher risk, stay home as much as possible and have supplies on hand to minimize the need for errands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay in contact over the phone or online with loved ones and caregivers. Review additional guidance for </span><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/High%20Risk%20Populations%20Guidance%20ADA%20Compliant%2003.11.20.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high risk individuals (pdf)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3 id="testing"><b>Testing and treatment</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California is rapidly expanding coronavirus testing. During this interim period while testing is expanding, testing is being prioritized for people who have coronavirus symptoms AND:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are over 60 years old, have a compromised immune system, or have serious chronic medical conditions, OR</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, OR</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are healthcare providers or work in a congregate setting with vulnerable populations (such as a long term care facility), OR</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveled to an </span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">area of concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past 14 days.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have coronavirus symptoms but are not in one of those groups, contact your healthcare provider for testing options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people who test positive for COVID-19 don’t need to go to the hospital. Local health departments and healthcare providers determine who needs hospitalization on a case-by-case basis. You may need evaluation if you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have difficulty breathing (shortness of breath)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel like you&#8217;re getting worse rapidly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are unable to care for symptoms at home</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get evaluated, </span><b>call your doctor for a phone evaluation first</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have a primary care physician or can’t reach them, contact your </span><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCLHO/CDPH%20Document%20Library/LHD_CD_Contact_Info_ADA.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local health department</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator you’re experiencing coronavirus symptoms so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn more about testing and treatment, see </span><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/nCoV2019.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Department of Public Health Coronavirus Updates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3 id="everyone-can-do"><b>What everyone can do</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People can spread this virus even if they never develop symptoms. Here’s how everyone can help keep communities healthy.</span></p>
<h4>DO</h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cough or sneeze into a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4> AVOID</h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaking hands.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact with people who are sick.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gatherings"><b>Cancel or postpone gatherings</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Department of Public Health recommends </span><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Gathering_Guidance_03.11.20.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canceling or postponing gatherings (pdf)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until at least the end of March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If gatherings are essential, increase safety by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding distance between where individuals sit or stand around tables.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding additional hand washing stations and restrooms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding direct physical contact, such as handshakes, holding hands, and hugging.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using phones, videos or video conferencing to reduce the need for close interactions.</span></li>
</ul>
