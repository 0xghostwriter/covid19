<p id="stay-home"><strong>Stay home if you have coronavirus symptoms.</strong> Symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>feeling like you have a fever</li>
	<li>a new cough</li>
	<li>shortness of breath</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stay home if you may have been exposed to COVID-19.</strong> This includes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>anyone who has traveled to an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">area of concern</a> within the last 14 days</li>
	<li>anyone who has been in close contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stay home if you’re at higher risk.</strong> Some people are more likely to get very sick from this new coronavirus, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>older adults (over 60 years old)</li>
	<li>people with compromised immune systems</li>
	<li>people with serious chronic medical conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>If you or someone you’re close to is at higher risk, avoid going out home and have supplies stored to minimize the need for errands.</p>

<p>Stay in contact over the phone or online with loved ones and caregivers. Review additional guidance for <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/High%20Risk%20Populations%20Guidance%20ADA%20Compliant%2003.11.20.pdf">high risk individuals (pdf)</a>.</p>

<h4 id="avoid-group-events"><b>Avoid group events</b></h4>

<p>People can spread this virus even if they never develop symptoms, so the State of California and many cities and counties are recommending people avoid unnecessary close contact with people outside of their home.</p>

<p>The California Department of Public Health recommends <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Gathering_Guidance_03.11.20.pdf">canceling or postponing gatherings (pdf)</a> until at least the end of March.</p>

<p>If gatherings are essential:</p>
<ul>
	<li>add distance between where individuals sit or stand</li>
	<li>add more hand washing stations and restrooms</li>
	<li>avoid direct physical contact (handshakes, holding hands, and hugging)</li>
	<li>use phones or video conferencing to reduce the need for close interactions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="testing"><b>Testing and treatment</b></h3>

<p>California is rapidly expanding coronavirus testing. During this interim period while testing is expanding, testing is being prioritized for people who <strong>have coronavirus symptoms AND:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>have had contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, OR</li>
<li>are healthcare providers or work in a congregate setting with vulnerable populations (such as a long term care facility), OR</li>
<li>traveled to an <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices">area of concern</a> in the past 14 days, OR</li>
<li>are over 60 years old, have a compromised immune system, or have serious chronic medical conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Most people who test positive for COVID-19 don’t need to go to the hospital.</strong></p>

<p>If you have coronavirus symptoms but are not in one of the priority testing groups, contact your healthcare provider for testing options. Local health departments and healthcare providers determine who needs testing and hospitalization on a case-by-case basis. You may need evaluation if you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>have difficulty breathing (shortness of breath)</li>
	<li>feel like you&#8217;re getting worse rapidly</li>
	<li>are unable to care for symptoms at home</li>
</ul>
<p>To get evaluated, <b>call your doctor for a phone evaluation first</b>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you don’t have a primary care physician or can’t reach them, contact your <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCLHO/CDPH%20Document%20Library/LHD_CD_Contact_Info_ADA.pdf">local health department</a>.</li>
	<li>If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival.</li>
	<li>If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator you’re experiencing coronavirus symptoms so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</li>
</ul>
