In addition to this update, the California Department of Public Health has released new guidance on the safe reopening of in-person learning at schools. To ensure safe in-person learning, schools may open if they are in a county that has been off the Monitoring List for 14 days and if they follow strict health and safety requirements including masks, symptoms checks, and switching back to distance learning when required. <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Schools%20Reopening%20Recommendations.pdf">Read the guidance here</a>.</p>
