<p><strong>Housing for the Harvest</strong> offers temporary housing to farm and food processing workers who need to isolate due to COVID-19. It helps exposed farmworkers protect their loved ones by giving them a space to self-isolate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Farmworkers play an essential role in maintaining our food supply. But some who need to self-isolate are finding it difficult due to their housing situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under this program, the state will pay for hotel rooms for farmworkers who need to self-isolate. The program will provide housing for up to 14 days per participant. It will also offer support such as meals, wellness checks, and other services. Local administrators will manage the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Housing for the Harvest is available statewide to any interested county or region.&nbsp; It will begin in regions with the most agricultural workers: Central Valley, Central Coast, and Imperial County. The program will expand as other areas opt in. Fresno, Stanislaus, and San Joaquin Counties have all shown interest in participating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
