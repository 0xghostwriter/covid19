<p>If you have coronavirus symptoms and think you need testing, contact your healthcare provider. Local health departments and healthcare providers determine who needs testing and hospitalization on a case-by-case basis. </p>



<p>Many people are able to recover from COVID-19 at home.</p>



<h4><strong>Seek treatment by calling your doctor for a phone evaluation if</strong>:</h4>



<ul><li>you have difficulty breathing (shortness of breath)</li><li>you feel like symptoms (such as fever and cough) are getting worse rapidly</li><li>you are unable to care for symptoms at home</li></ul>



<p>If you need to go to the hospital, <strong>call ahead</strong> so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator you’re experiencing coronavirus symptoms so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</p>



<h4><strong>California is expanding coronavirus testing capacity daily.</strong></h4>

<p>Governor Newsom announced <a href="https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/">COVID-19 Testing Task Force</a>, a public-private collaboration that aims to quickly and significantly boost California’s testing capacity. The Task Force will work to scale up testing as demand increases.</p>



<p>As capacity increases, testing will expand according to the discretion of the Local Health Officer. Priorities will be:</p>



<p><strong><em>Tier 1</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Hospitalized patients</li><li>Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers, first responders, and other social service employees</li><li>Symptomatic persons &gt;65 years of age OR any age with chronic medical conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 illness&nbsp;</li><li>Persons identified for testing by public health contact investigations and disease control activities in high risk settings</li><li>Screening of asymptomatic residents or employees of congregate living facilities including:<ul><li>After positive cases have been identified in a facility</li><li>Prior to resident admission or readmission to a facility</li></ul></li><li>Symptomatic and asymptomatic persons in essential occupations<ul><li>Examples: Utility workers, grocery store workers, food supply workers, and other public employees</li></ul></li><li>Lower risk symptomatic persons</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Tier 2</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Lower risk asymptomatic persons</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Community surveillance</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Surveillance testing of asymptomatic persons as part of community or regional surveillance programs</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Drive-through testing (Project Baseline)</strong></h2>



<p>This California community-based <a href="https://blog.verily.com/2020/03/california-opens-two-new-community_23.html">COVID-19 testing program</a> is a state-directed, federally-supported program in collaboration with Verily’s Project Baseline which will expand access to COVID-19 screening and testing for high-risk individuals in certain areas of the state.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/"><strong>Complete the screener</strong></a><strong> to see if you qualify for testing through this program.</strong> You will need internet access and a Google account.</p>



<p>Drive-through testing sites are now open in the following locations:</p>



<p>Northern California</p>



<ul><li>Sacramento (Sacramento County)</li><li>Stockton (San Joaquin County)</li><li>San Mateo (San Mateo County)</li><li>San Jose (Santa Clara County)</li><li>Salida (Stanislaus County)</li><li>Napa (Napa County)</li></ul>



<p>Southern California</p>



<ul><li>Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles County)</li><li>Lake Elsinore (Riverside County)</li><li>Long Beach (Los Angeles County)</li></ul>



<p>Testing is expanding to more locations. See the Project Baseline website for  <a href="https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/">current testing locations</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong> (Project Baseline)</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How is testing eligibility determined?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This program is first focusing on high-risk populations as advised by national guidelines and the California Department of Public Health. This will initially include those who are exhibiting symptoms and have other risk factors. We are working to rapidly expand testing and will be updating the eligibility criteria once more tests become available.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How much does it cost to be tested?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Testing through the program is provided free of cost.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How do I get tested?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are two steps to this process: screening and testing. First, you will create an account and take the online screener. If your answers from the screener determine you are eligible at this time, you will receive details on how and where to get tested. Once tested, you’ll be informed via email or phone when your COVID-19 test results are available.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Why am I asked to create an account?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For the Baseline COVID-19 Program to work, Verily needs a way to authenticate users to appropriately protect their information. Verily turned to Google for this service because Google Account provides best-in-class authentication. We ask that you link to an existing Google Account or create a new Google Account (which can be done with any email address). This lets us both authenticate your account, and securely and privately contact you during the screening and testing process. All the data provided by Baseline COVID-19 Program users for screening is stored separately and not directly linked to a user’s Google Account.</p>
