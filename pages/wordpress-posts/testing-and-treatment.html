<p>If you have coronavirus symptoms and think you need testing, contact your healthcare provider. Local health departments and healthcare providers determine who needs testing and hospitalization on a case-by-case basis. </p>



<p>Many people are able to recover from COVID-19 at home.</p>



<p><strong>Seek treatment by calling your doctor for a phone evaluation if</strong>:</p>



<ul><li>you have difficulty breathing (shortness of breath)</li><li>you feel like symptoms (such as fever and cough) are getting worse rapidly</li><li>you are unable to care for symptoms at home</li></ul>



<p>If you need to go to the hospital, <strong>call ahead</strong> so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator you’re experiencing coronavirus symptoms so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</p>



<h4>California is expanding coronavirus testing capacity daily. </h4>



<p>Governor Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/04/governor-newsom-launches-one-stop-website-for-donations-sales-of-essential-medical-supplies-in-fight-against-covid-19/">announced the COVID-19 Testing Task Force</a>, a public-private collaboration that will work with stakeholders across the state to quickly and significantly boost California’s testing capacity. The Task Force plans to scale up testing as demand increases.</p>



<p>During this interim period while testing is expanding, testing is being prioritized for people who:</p>



<ul><li><strong>have coronavirus symptoms</strong> <strong>AND</strong></li><li>have one of these risk factors:<ul><li>are hospitalized,  </li><li>are a resident or staff of long-term health and correctional facilities OR</li><li>work in a healthcare facility, OR</li><li>are in prison OR</li><li>are over 60 years old, have a compromised immune system, or have serious chronic medical conditions.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>The California community-based <a href="https://blog.verily.com/2020/03/california-opens-two-new-community_23.html">COVID-19 testing program</a> is a state-directed, federally supported program in collaboration with Verily&#8217;s Project Baseline which will expand access to COVID-19 screening and testing for high risk individuals, in certain areas of the state. If you are in <strong>Santa Clara or San Mateo County, or within 50 miles of the city of Riverside, or the city of Sacramento</strong> and want to get tested for COVID-19, you can <a href="https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/">complete the screener</a> to see if you qualify for testing through this program. You will need internet access and a Google account.</p>
