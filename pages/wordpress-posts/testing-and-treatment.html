<h2 class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Find a testing location</h2>

<h2>Types of tests</h2>



<p>Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: Tests for current COVID-19 infection (also known as <strong>viral PCR tests</strong>) and tests for past infection (also known as <strong>antibody </strong>or <strong>serology tests</strong>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>California’s community-based <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401">testing</a> sites by Verily’s Project Baseline and OptumServe provide viral <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401">tests</a> to determine if individuals have COVID-19.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">What is an antibody test? Where can I get an antibody test?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">Antibody tests</a> detect past infections (but not current infections). They are used to detect past COVID-19 infections in an individual and can be used to determine if you are a good candidate to <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/plasma">donate blood plasma</a>. It can take 1-3 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">You can find locations for both viral and antibody <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401">tests</a> on <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401">California’s testing map</a>.</p>



<h2>Cost for testing&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are no out-of-pocket costs for <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf">necessary</a> testing. If you have medical insurance, Verily or OptumServe will bill your insurance company. If you’re uninsured, your viral test is paid for by the <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim">government</a>.</p>



<h2>Who can get tested</h2>



<p>Testing is prioritized for individuals who are at high risk, including hospitalized patients, healthcare workers, first responders and essential workers, people with symptoms, residents and employees in group living facilities and people who may have been exposed in high-risk situations. As testing capacity continues to increase statewide, local health officers can expand testing within their communities. See current public health <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Expanding-Access-to-Testing-Updated-Interim-Guidance-on-Prioritization-for-COVID-19-Laboratory-Testing-0501.aspx">testing guidance</a>.</p>



<h2>How you can get tested</h2>



<p>California has partnered with Verily and OptumServe to provide free, confidential testing statewide. The state’s testing program ensures that every county has enough testing capacity, and that tests are available for underserved communities and individuals who are at high risk of contracting COVID-19 or becoming seriously ill from the virus.</p>

<h4><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong> (Verily&#8217;s Project Baseline)</h4>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How do I get a drive-through test?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are two steps to this process: screening and testing. First, you will create an account and take the online screener. If your answers from the screener determine you are eligible at this time, you will receive details on how and where to get tested. Once tested, you’ll be informed via email or phone when your COVID-19 test results are available.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>Why am I asked to create an account for drive-through testing using Verily’s Project Baseline?</strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For the Baseline COVID-19 Program to work, Verily needs a way to authenticate users to appropriately protect their information. Verily turned to Google for this service because Google Account provides best-in-class authentication. We ask that you link to an existing Google Account or create a new Google Account (which can be done with any email address). This lets Verily authenticate your account, and securely and privately contact you during the screening and testing process. All the data provided by Baseline COVID-19 Program users for screening is stored separately and not directly linked to a user’s Google Account.</p>



<h2>OptumServe testing sites</h2>



<p>Tests are by appointment only. Find a location near you and make an appointment at:</p>

<p>OptumServe community testing sites serve all individuals who qualify for a test, including uninsured, underinsured, undocumented and homeless individuals. OptumServe will generate a unique identification number for individuals who do not have a driver’s license.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Treatment questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need emergency treatment?</h4>

<h3>California’s Testing Task Force</h3>



<p>California’s <a href="https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/">COVID-19 Testing Task Force</a> works to ensure that Californians who need a COVID-19 test have access to tests and that there’s enough laboratory capacity to meet demand.&nbsp;</p>
