<h4><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong> (Project Baseline)</h4>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How do I get a drive-through test?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are two steps to this process: screening and testing. First, you will create an account and take the online screener. If your answers from the screener determine you are eligible at this time, you will receive details on how and where to get tested. Once tested, you’ll be informed via email or phone when your COVID-19 test results are available.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>Why am I asked to create an account for drive-through testing using Verily’s Project Baseline?</strong> </strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For the Baseline COVID-19 Program to work, Verily needs a way to authenticate users to appropriately protect their information. Verily turned to Google for this service because Google Account provides best-in-class authentication. We ask that you link to an existing Google Account or create a new Google Account (which can be done with any email address). This lets Verily authenticate your account, and securely and privately contact you during the screening and testing process. All the data provided by Baseline COVID-19 Program users for screening is stored separately and not directly linked to a user’s Google Account.</p>



<h3><strong>Testing for underserved communities (OptumServe)</strong></h3>



<p>The State of California has joined together with OptumServe to expand testing services for underserved communities and some of California’s most vulnerable patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cost:</strong> There are no out-of-pocket costs for testing. If you have medical insurance, OptumServe will bill your insurance company. If you’re uninsured, your test is paid for by the state.</p>



<p>Tests are by appointment only. Make an appointment at <a href="https://lhi.care/covidtesting">https://lhi.care/covidtesting</a>. If you do not have internet access, call: <a href="tel:[1-888-634-1123]">1-888-634-1123</a>.</p>



<p>Anyone who meets the testing criteria can be tested at an OptumServe community testing site, including uninsured, underinsured, undocumented and homeless individuals. OptumServe will generate a unique identification number for individuals who do not have a driver’s license.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How to get treatment</strong></h2>



<p>If you develop any of these warning signs for COVID-19, get emergency medical attention immediately:</p>



<ul><li>Trouble breathing</li><li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li><li>New confusion or inability to awake</li><li>Bluish lips or face</li></ul>



<p>If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival. If you call 911, tell the operator you have coronavirus symptoms so ambulance workers can be ready to treat you safely.</p>
