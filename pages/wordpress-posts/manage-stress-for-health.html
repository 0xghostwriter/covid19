<p>While we take action to lessen the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on our communities and our health care systems, it is also important to minimize the secondary health effects of this pandemic. Widespread stress and anxiety regarding COVID-19, compounded by the economic distress due to lost wages, employment and financial assets; mass school closures; and necessary physical distancing measures can result in an increase of stress-related health conditions. <br>The California Surgeon General has <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/wp/california-surgeon-general_stress-busting-playbook_draft-v2clean_ada-04072020.pdf"><strong>a simple guide</strong></a><strong> </strong>with things you can do every day, at home, to help support your mental and physical health, utilizing six key strategies:</p>



<p></p>



<ul><li><strong>Supportive relationships:</strong> Maintain supportive relationships<strong> </strong>wherever you can, including virtually.</li><li><strong>Exercise: </strong>Engage in 60 minutes of physical activity every day, if you can. It doesn’t have to be all at one time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Get sufficient, high-quality sleep. This may be particularly hard right now, but going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day can help.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Ensure you are getting proper nutrition to help combat stress.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mental health support:</strong> <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/resources-for-emotional-support-and-well-being/">Resources available here.</a></li><li><strong>Mindfulness:</strong> Practice <a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/ucla-mindful-app">mindfulness</a> in whatever way works best for you. This could be things like meditation, yoga, or prayer for 20 minutes, two times a day.&nbsp;</li></ul>
