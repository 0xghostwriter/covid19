<p>If you’re an immigrant living in California, here is what you need to know to protect yourself, your family, and your community from coronavirus. Services and public benefits are available to you, some regardless of immigration status. And <a href="http://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/immigration/covid-19-drai">special assistance for immigrant Californians</a> who don’t qualify for other programs can be applied for starting May 18.</p>



<h2>Testing and treatment</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Don’t let fear stop you from getting necessary treatment</strong>, </strong>as the effects of avoiding health care services may be very serious. This will help keep you, your family, and your community healthy.</p>



<p>If you’re undocumented or don’t have insurance, you can still get COVID-19 testing and treatment through Medi-Cal. This care does not count under the public charge rule because it is treatment for an emergency medical condition.</p>

<h2>Disaster Relief Assistance for Immigrants</h2>



<p>On April 15, Governor Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/15/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-support-california-workers-impacted-by-covid-19/">announced</a> one-time disaster relief assistance for undocumented Californians impacted by COVID-19, who are ineligible for most other forms of pandemic assistance, including direct assistance under the CARES Act and unemployment insurance.</p>



<p>Eligible Californians may receive one-time COVID-19 disaster relief assistance at a value of $500. A limit of two adults per household can receive this assistance (maximum assistance of $1,000 per household).</p>



<p>The CA Department of Social Services (CDSS) has selected <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/immigration/covid-19-drai">12 nonprofits</a> to help individuals apply for and get this help in their region.</p>
