<p>If you’re an immigrant living in California, here is what you need to know to protect yourself, your family, and your community from coronavirus. Services and public benefits are available to you, some regardless of immigration status.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Don’t let fear stop you from getting necessary treatment</strong>, as the effects of avoiding health care services may be very serious. This will help keep you, your family, and your community healthy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if you are undocumented and/or don’t have insurance, you can get necessary testing and treatment for COVID-19 through Medi-Cal emergency services, even at a local clinic. Medi-Cal care for COVID-19 related testing or treatment <strong>does not</strong> count under the public charge rule because it is the treatment of an emergency medical condition.</p>
