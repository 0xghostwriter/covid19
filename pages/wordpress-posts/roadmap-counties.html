<p>Local health jurisdictions that meet the criteria set forth by the California Department of Public Health and follow the process in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx" target="_blank">county guidance</a> may move further<strong> </strong>ahead in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/" target="_blank">resilience roadmap</a>.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>County criteria to move further ahead in the resilience roadmap:</strong></strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>County case metrics</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Stable or down trending hospitalizations</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Stable hospitalizations of COVID individuals on a 7-day average of daily percent change of less than 5% <strong>OR</strong> no more than 20 COVID hospitalizations on any single day in the past 14 days&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Cases per population count and test positivity rate</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Less than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days <strong>OR </strong>less than 8% testing positive in the past 7 days</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>County preparedness</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Testing capacity</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Minimum daily testing volume to test 1.5 per 1,000 residents, which can be met through a combination of testing of symptomatic individuals and targeted surveillance.&nbsp; The county&#8217;s average daily testing volume for the past week must be provided.&nbsp; If the county does not believe a testing volume of 1.5 per 1,000 residents is merited, justification must be provided.&nbsp;</li><li>Testing availability for at least 75% of residents, as measured by a specimen collection site (including established health care providers) within 30 minutes driving time in urban areas, and 60 minutes in rural areas.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Contact tracing</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Sufficient contact tracing so public health staff work can work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the timeframe while they may have been infectious.&nbsp; For counties that have no cases, there should be at least 15 staff per 100,000 county population trained and available for contact tracing; for counties with small populations, there must be at least one staff person trained and available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Hospital surge</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>County (or regional) hospital capacity to accommodate a minimum surge of 35% due to COVID-19 cases in addition to providing usual care for non-COVID-19 patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>SNF disease outbreak prevention and containment</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Must have plans to prevent and mitigate infections in skilled nursing facilities</li><li>Skilled nursing facilities (SNF) have more than a 14 day supply of PPE on hand for staff, with an established process for ongoing procurement from non-state supply chains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>County response</strong></h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Counties must produce plans for the following related to county-wide containment:<ul><li>Availability of temporary housing units to shelter at least 15% of county residents experiencing homelessness in case of an outbreak among this population requiring isolation and quarantine of affected individuals. The county&#8217;s plans to support individuals, including those experiencing homelessness, who are not able to properly isolate in a home setting by providing them with temporary housing (including access to a private bathroom), for the duration of the necessary isolation or quarantine period must be described.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>County (or regional) hospital facilities have a robust plan to protect the hospital workforce, both clinical and nonclinical, with PPE.  </li><li>Guidance for employers and essential critical infrastructure workplaces on how to structure the physical environment to protect essential workers.  </li><li>Availability of supplies (disinfectant, essential protective gear) to protect essential workers. </li><li>Each county must provide details on their plans to move further ahead in the resilience roadmap including which sectors and spaces will be opened, in what sequence, on what timeline.  Please specifically indicate where the plan differs from the state&#8217;s order.  Please note that this variance should not include sectors that are part of Stage 3.</li><li>County metrics that would serve as triggers for either slowing the pace through Stage 2 or tightening modifications, including the frequency of measurement, the specific actions triggered by metric changes must be described, and how the county will inform the state of emerging concerns and how it will implement early containment measures. </li><li>The county must provide details on the plan to move through opening sectors and spaces that are part of the State&#8217;s plan for Stage 2. A reminder, that this variance only covers those areas that are part of Stage 2, up to, but not including Stage 3. </li></ul>
