<p>Each county and local government in California is working along with the state to protect people experiencing homelessness during COVID-19 and prevent others from losing their homes during the outbreak.</p>



<p><strong>People experiencing homelessness</strong></p>



<p>Individuals and families experiencing homelessness can contact their local homeless <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/coc_poc.pdf">Continuum of Care</a>. In many communities, they can also call 211 for assistance.</p>



<p><strong>Emergency shelters (including hotels and motels)</strong></p>



<p>Homeless Assistance Providers should coordinate with their local homeless <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/coc_poc.pdf">Continuum of Care</a>, County Office of Emergency Management Contacts, County Social Services agencies, tribes, and other partners, to determine their community’s need for hotel/motel rooms to accommodate homeless individuals and families and request support from the state.</p>



<p><strong>Preventing new evictions</strong></p>



<p>Under the Governor’s<a href="https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.ca.gov%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F03%2F3.27.20-EO-N-37-20.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKate.Folmar%40chhs.ca.gov%7Cdefbebeb6b7d424f4c5008d7d65a29e8%7C265c2dcd2a6e43aab2e826421a8c8526%7C0%7C0%7C637213555726994044&amp;sdata=EOgdgdxNP2zQmYWdxdZF70bi%2BrgK4CqQrQKS%2Flh0d40%3D&amp;reserved=0"> Executive Order</a>, through May 31, 2020, evictions related to non-payment of rent for COVID-19-related economic hardships have been halted. If you are financially impacted by COVID-19 and can’t pay your full rent, make sure to let your landlord know in writing no later than seven days after the rent is due, and save documentation as proof.  Learn of other <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-financial-help/#top">financial assistance</a>.</p>



<p>Many utility providers are not shutting off services due to non-payment. Check with the<a href="https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cpuc.ca.gov%2Fcovid19protections%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKate.Folmar%40chhs.ca.gov%7Cdefbebeb6b7d424f4c5008d7d65a29e8%7C265c2dcd2a6e43aab2e826421a8c8526%7C0%7C0%7C637213555727004037&amp;sdata=CCXxeLIIZlQZdgnUgu7e%2BS%2Frci%2BPRBsmsL%2Bk%2BAMN%2B0M%3D&amp;reserved=0"> California Public Utilities Commission</a> for more information. </p>



<p>The Governor has also <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-financial-help/#top">reached an agreement</a> with financial institutions to give relief to people who can’t pay their mortgages as a result of COVID-19. California is placing a moratorium on foreclosure sales or evictions for 60 days.</p>

<p><strong>I am homeless and I may have come in contact with coronavirus. How can I self-isolate with nowhere to go and services closing down?</strong></p>
