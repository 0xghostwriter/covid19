<p>Each county is working with the state to protect people experiencing homelessness during COVID-19. Counties are also working to prevent others from losing their homes.</p>



<h4><strong>People experiencing homelessness</strong></h4>



<p>Individuals and families experiencing homelessness can contact their local homeless <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/coc_poc.pdf">continuum of care</a>. In many communities, they can also call 211 for help.</p>



<p>Individuals can get a room in a hotel and motel room through <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/FEMA/Project-Roomkey-Fact-Sheet.pdf">Project Roomkey</a> and the state’s partnership with Motel 6.</p>



<h4><strong><strong>Homeless assistance providers</strong></strong></h4>



<p>If you are a homeless assistance provider, you should determine your community’s need for rooms before you request support from the state. Work with your local <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/coc_poc.pdf">Continuum of Care</a>, emergency management, social services, tribes, and other partners.</p>



<p>California has set aside $150 million in emergency funding to protect the homeless during COVID-19. Here are some <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/hcfc/documents/covid19_funding_faqs.pdf">FAQs for homeless assistance providers</a> about those funds.</p>



<h4><strong><strong><strong>Help for renters and homeowners</strong></strong></strong></h4>



<p>If COVID-19 has impacted your ability to pay all or part of your rent, you should:</p>



<ul><li>Explain your financial situation to your landlord and tell them how much you can pay&nbsp;</li><li>Save all financial documents&nbsp;</li><li>Pay as much of your rent as you can</li></ul>



<p>The Governor <a href="https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.ca.gov%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F03%2F3.27.20-EO-N-37-20.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7CKate.Folmar%40chhs.ca.gov%7Cdefbebeb6b7d424f4c5008d7d65a29e8%7C265c2dcd2a6e43aab2e826421a8c8526%7C0%7C0%7C637213555726994044&amp;sdata=EOgdgdxNP2zQmYWdxdZF70bi%2BrgK4CqQrQKS%2Flh0d40%3D&amp;reserved=0">ordered evictions halted</a> through July 28, 2020. If your landlord is attempting to evict you for not paying rent and you took all of the above steps, contact a local legal aid provider and <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/coronavirus19/renters_mortgage_guidance.pdf">learn about your protections</a>.</p>



<p>If you can’t pay your mortgage, these<a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/"> financial institutions</a> may be able to reduce or delay your monthly payment. In addition, they will:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Give you a streamlined process for requesting forbearance for COVID-19-related reasons, supported with available documentation;</li><li>Confirm approval of and terms of the forbearance program; and</li><li>Provide you the opportunity to extend your forbearance agreement if you continue to experience hardship due to COVID-19.</li></ul>



<p>California has also stopped foreclosure sales or evictions for 60 days. Learn more about other <a href="https://www.bcsh.ca.gov/coronavirus19/renters_mortgage_guidance.pdf">mortgage protections and resources (PDF)</a>.</p>
