<p>On July 17, 2020, updated guidance was released for childcare, day camps, and schools. Find this guidance and more in the list of <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#statewide-guidance">statewide guidance and checklists</a>.</p>



<p>On June 18, 2020, CDPH issued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">Guidance on the&nbsp;Use of Face Coverings</a>, which broadly requires the use of face coverings in California when in public or common spaces.&nbsp;Complete details, including all requirements and exceptions to these rules, can be found in the guidance.</p>



<p>The industry-specific guidance below applies to businesses statewide. Review the guidance that is relevant to your workplace, make a plan, and put it into action.

<p>Some counties have received state approval to move further into the reopening roadmap. To see guidance for industry sectors allowed to reopen in counties with state approval, see the list of <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#county-attest">guidance for counties with attestations</a>.</p>



<p>Before reopening, all facilities <strong>must:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Perform a detailed risk assessment and create a site-specific protection plan</li><li>Train employees on how to limit the spread of COVID-19. This includes how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">screen themselves for symptoms</a> and when to stay home.</li><li>Set up individual control measures and screenings</li><li>Put disinfection protocols in place</li><li>Establish physical distancing guidelines</li></ol>



<p>It’s important that employees with COVID-19 know they should stay home. Your sick leave policies will need to support that. See information on:</p>
