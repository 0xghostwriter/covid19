<p>Local health jurisdictions that meet the criteria set forth by the California Department of Public Health and follow the process in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx" target="_blank">county guidance</a>&nbsp;may move&nbsp;further<strong>&nbsp;</strong>ahead in the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/" target="_blank">Resilience Roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>If a county decides to pursue a variance to move further ahead in the Resilience Roadmap, the local public health officer must:</p>



<ol><li>Notify the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).</li><li>Certify through submission of a written attestation to CDPH that the county has met the readiness criteria (outlined below), including guidance to be issued by the county and detailed plans, and that the county is designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</li></ol>



<p>See the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx">list of counties</a> that have met the criteria.</p>



<h3><strong><strong>County criteria to move further ahead in the Resilience Roadmap</strong></strong></h3>

<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Stable or down trending hospitalizations</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Stable hospitalizations of COVID individuals on a 7-day average of daily percent change of less than 5% <strong>OR</strong> no more than 20 COVID hospitalizations on any single day in the past 14 days&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Cases per population count and test positivity rate</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Less than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days <strong>OR </strong>less than 8% testing positive in the past 7 days</li></ul>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Minimum daily testing volume to test 1.5 per 1,000 residents, which can be met through a combination of testing of symptomatic individuals and targeted surveillance.&nbsp; The county&#8217;s average daily testing volume for the past week must be provided.&nbsp; If the county does not believe a testing volume of 1.5 per 1,000 residents is merited, justification must be provided.&nbsp;</li><li>Testing availability for at least 75% of residents, as measured by a specimen collection site (including established health care providers) within 30 minutes driving time in urban areas, and 60 minutes in rural areas.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Contact tracing</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Sufficient contact tracing so public health staff work can work with a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during the timeframe while they may have been infectious.&nbsp; For counties that have no cases, there should be at least 15 staff per 100,000 county population trained and available for contact tracing; for counties with small populations, there must be at least one staff person trained and available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Hospital surge</strong></p>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Counties must produce plans for the following related to county-wide containment:<ul><li>Availability of temporary housing units to shelter at least 15% of county residents experiencing homelessness in case of an outbreak among this population requiring isolation and quarantine of affected individuals. The county&#8217;s plans to support individuals, including those experiencing homelessness, who are not able to properly isolate in a home setting by providing them with temporary housing (including access to a private bathroom), for the duration of the necessary isolation or quarantine period must be described.</li></ul></li></ul>

A reminder, that this variance only covers those areas that are part of Stage 2, up to, but not including Stage 3.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2><strong>County data monitoring</strong></h2>



<p>California is <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx">monitoring COVID-19 closely</a> in each local community and keeping the public informed. Weâ€™re teaming up with counties to fight it with every tool we have: <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyDataTable.aspx">current local data</a>, testing, contact tracing, infection control, emergency supplies, containment measures, and more.</p>



<p>Counties should be ready to restore limitations if outbreaks increase. The State Public Health Officer may take action if needed.</p>



<p>The three steps below outline the county data monitoring process. </p>
