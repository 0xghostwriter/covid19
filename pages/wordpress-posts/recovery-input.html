<p>California is building a roadmap for modifying the statewide stay home order while maintaining community health and resiliency. We need Californians to give input on the best way to reopen different sectors of our economy.</p>



<p>Good ideas come from everywhere. The state has received many innovative proposals from California businesses and labor representatives on how they’re adapting their workplaces to reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we’d like to hear from you– business owners, workers, customers – to get your feedback on physical and environmental adaptations that can make workplaces safer and protect our communities.</p>



<p>Help shape a more resilient future for California.&nbsp; Fill out the California Recovery Roadmap Survey.</p>
