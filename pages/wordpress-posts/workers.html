<p>The state has <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/12/governor-newsom-issues-new-executive-order-further-enhancing-state-and-local-governments-ability-to-respond-to-covid-19-pandemic/">removed waiting periods</a> for unemployment and disability insurance for Californians who lose work as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>



<p>Check EDD’s <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019.htm">programs and benefits for workers affected by COVID-19</a> for the latest news.</p>



<h3>Help for self employed and independent contractors</h3>



<p>On April 28, the state rolled out a new program to help unemployed or partially unemployed Californians who are business owners, self-employed, independent contractors, and others who are financially impacted by the pandemic. This is a federally funded program called the <a href="https://edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/coronavirus-2019/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.htm">Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program</a>. PUA benefits are available if you don’t qualify for regular UI benefits in California or another state, and also don’t qualify for State Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits. PUA benefits <a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Labor-Secretary-Letter-04.14.20.pdf">will be issued within 24-48 hours</a>, not the traditional 21 days ​for regular UI claims.</p>



<p>California workers who receive Unemployment Insurance (UI) or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) benefits between March 29 and July 25, 2020 will get <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/cares-act.htm#PAC">$600 per week added</a> automatically to their benefits through the federal CARES Act.</p>



<p>If you’ve used all of your available Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits, an additional 13 weeks of benefits may be available through the federally funded <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019/cares-act.htm#PEUC">Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
