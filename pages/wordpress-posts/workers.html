<p>California is working to support people financially affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Learn more in this<a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/coronavirus2019/#chart"> chart of benefits available for workers.</a></p>



<p>The state has removed waiting periods for unemployment and disability insurance for Californians who lose work as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>



<p>Starting April 12, California workers who are receiving unemployment insurance (UI) benefits began receiving an additional $600 per week.</p>



<p>Starting April 28, the state will be rolling out a new program to help unemployed or partially unemployed Californians who are business owners, self-employed, independent contractors, and others who are financially impacted by the pandemic. This is a federally funded program called the <a href="https://edd.ca.gov/About_EDD/coronavirus-2019/pandemic-unemployment-assistance.htm">Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program</a>. The PUA benefits will be available if you don’t qualify for regular UI benefits in California or another state, and also don’t qualify for State Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits. PUA benefits <a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Labor-Secretary-Letter-04.14.20.pdf">will be issued within 24-48 hours</a>, not the traditional 21 days ​for regular UI claims.</p>



<p>See other <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/about_edd/coronavirus-2019.htm">programs and benefits for workers affected by COVID-19</a> for more information and the latest news.</p>
