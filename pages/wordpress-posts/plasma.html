<h2>Your blood could save lives</h2>



<p>The antibodies of&nbsp;COVID-19-recovered patients could help fight infection in those still suffering from it. The only source of these antibodies is the blood plasma of coronavirus survivors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving blood plasma to a COVID-19 patient from a person who has healed from it might help the sick person get better faster. But we need more of this plasma to find out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The California Department of Public Health has mailed letters, including translation in seven languages, to encourage Californians who have had a positive test to consider donating their plasma to help develop treatments for COVID-19.</p>



<p><strong>Your blood plasma donation could help up to 4 people suffering from COVID-19.</strong></p>



<h2>Who can donate COVID-19 plasma?</h2>



<ul><li>A person who had a test that showed coronavirus infection, <br>AND</li><li>Has felt well for at least 28 days*,<br>AND</li><li>Passes the usual rules for blood donation.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>*If you want to donate before one month has passed since you recovered, please check with your blood center. <strong>Some</strong> centers will require a negative swab test, and may have other rules.</p>



<h2>What are the risks?</h2>



<p>It is generally very safe for people to donate blood plasma. Your local blood donation center can tell you more about the risks and benefits of donation.</p>



<p>Donating is voluntary. Your decision to donate or not will not change your eligibility for medical or public health services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is not a participant or sponsor of research for COVID-19, but is supporting the work of medical providers across the state by inviting you to donate your blood plasma.</p>
