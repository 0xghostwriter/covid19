<p>Californians have been staying home and saving lives since the start of our statewide stay-at-home order issued on March 19, 2020. These efforts have allowed the state to move forward on our <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Update-on-California-Pandemic-Roadmap.pdf">roadmap</a> for modifying the statewide order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are now moving into <strong>Stage 2, </strong>where some lower-risk workplaces can gradually open with adaptations. The state is issuing guidance to help these workplaces reopen safely.</p>

<p>Stage 2 expansion will be phased in gradually. Some communities may move through Stage 2 faster if they are able to show greater progress and counties that have met the readiness criteria and worked with the California Department of Public Health can open more workplaces as outlined in the <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap-counties">County Variance Guidance</a><strong>.</strong></p>



<h2>Industry guidance to reduce the risk</h2>



<p>California will move into Stage 2 of modifying the state’s Stay-at-Home order on May 8, 2020. Our progress in achieving key <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/ygO/7rmtB/tBgtmyuzjanmc/8t71/8l9ety77/5hq/2tBncv">public health metrics</a> will allow a gradual re-opening of California’s economy.</p>



<p>We recognize the impact of economic hardship. We must get our economy roaring once again and put paychecks in people’s pockets. But the risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal.</p>



<p>That is why every business should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection:</p>



<ul><li>Plan and prepare for re-opening</li><li>Make radical changes within the workplace</li><li>Adjust practices by employees and help educate customers</li></ul>



<p>Below are guidance for each early Stage 2 business to follow. The goal is a safe, clean environment for workers and customers. Businesses may use effective alternative or innovative methods to build upon the guidance.</p>



<p>Review the guidance that is relevant to your workplace, prepare a plan based on the guidance for your industry, and put it into action. </p>



<p>When complete, you can post the industry-specific checklist (below) in your workplace to show your customers and your employees that you&#8217;ve reduced the risk and open for business.</p>



<p>Before, reopening, all facilities <strong>must:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Perform a detailed risk assessment and implement a site-specific protection plan</li><li>Train employees on how to limit the spread of COVID-19, including how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">screen themselves for symptoms</a> and stay home if they have them</li><li>Implement individual control measures and screenings</li><li>Implement disinfecting protocols</li><li>Implement physical distancing guidelines</li></ol>



<p>To provide your input on future industry guidance, fill out the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/recovery-input/">California Recovery Roadmap survey</a>.</p>



<p>It is critical that employees needing to self-isolate because of COVID-19 are encouraged to stay at home, with sick leave policies to support that, to prevent further infection in your workplace. Additional information on government programs supporting sick leave and worker&#8217;s compensation for COVID-19 can be found<a href="https://www.labor.ca.gov/coronavirus2019#chart"> here</a>.</p>

<h2>Customers and individuals</h2>



<p>Customers and individuals are encouraged to stay home if they have a fever or other COVID-19 symptoms. Those with symptoms or elevated temperatures should not shop, get services in person, go to work or congregate with others. If you’re not sure if this applies to you, check your symptoms with this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a>.</p>



<p>Higher risk individuals should continue to stay home until Stage 4.</p>



<h2><strong>Roadmap for Reopening Businesses</strong></h2>



<p>Before re-opening, all facilities <strong>must</strong> first perform a detailed risk assessment and implement a site-specific protection plan. Adaptations need to be made before Stage 2 workplaces can open – currently that includes modifications like curbside pickup at retail locations.&nbsp;</p>
