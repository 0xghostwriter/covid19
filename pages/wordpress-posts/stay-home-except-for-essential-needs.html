<h2 id="faq">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3>What is the relationship between the order and these questions and answers?</h3>



<p>The Governor has ordered Californians to obey the directives of the State Public Health Officer. Those directives take many forms; they include specific materials linked on this page, as well as these questions and answers. These questions and answers are directives from the State Public Health Officer, and have the same force and effect as other State Public Health Officer directives.</p>



<h3>When does the stay home order go into effect and how long will we stay home? What areas of the state are covered?</h3>



<p>The order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020. The order is in place until further notice. It covers the whole state of California.</p>



<p>As of May 8, the stay home order was modified. We are now in the first phase of <strong>Stage 2</strong>. This means in addition to essential activity,  retail is allowed, along with the infrastructure to support it. As of May 12, offices, limited services, and outdoor museums are also permitted to open.</p>



<p>Six key health and scientific&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/14/governor-newsom-outlines-six-critical-indicators-the-state-will-consider-before-modifying-the-stay-at-home-order-and-other-covid-19-interventions/" target="_blank">indicators</a>&nbsp;will be considered before modifying the state’s stay home order to allow additional Stage 2 activity.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="open">What’s open?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Essential services</strong> that protect public health, public safety, and provide essential needs will remain open, such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Gas stations&nbsp;</li><li>Pharmacies</li><li>Food: Grocery stores, farmers markets, food banks, convenience stores, take-out and delivery restaurants&nbsp;</li><li>Banks&nbsp;</li><li>Laundromats/laundry services&nbsp;</li><li>Essential state and local government functions will also remain open, including law enforcement and offices that provide government programs and services.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Businesses in a number of other sectors can now also open, with necessary modifications.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Retailers</strong> can open statewide. All will require modifications to support social distancing. This includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Shopping malls</li><li>Libraries (for delivery and curbside pickup)</li><li>Drive-in theaters (with modifications)</li><li>Bookstores</li><li>Jewelry stores</li><li>Toy stores</li><li>Clothing and shoe stores</li><li>Home and furnishing stores</li><li>Sporting goods stores</li><li>Florists</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Offices</strong>&nbsp;(in all sectors, not only critical infrastructure)</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Limited services</strong>&nbsp;which do not generally require close customer contact, such as:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Pet grooming</li><li>Dog walking</li><li>Car washes</li><li>Appliance repair</li><li>Residential and janitorial cleaning</li><li>Places of worship (with modifications)</li><li>Plumbing</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><strong>Outdoor museums</strong></p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The following may open only in counties approved to move further ahead in Stage 2:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Dine-in restaurants</li><li>Hair salons and barber shops</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What’s closed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Statewide, the following are still closed:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Bars and nightclubs&nbsp;</li><li>Entertainment venues&nbsp;</li><li>Gyms and fitness studios&nbsp;</li><li>Public events and gatherings&nbsp;</li><li>Convention centers</li><li>Nail salons</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">However, if your county has a variance, the following may open:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Dine-in restaurants</li><li>Hair salons and barber shops</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Can I get a haircut?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. If your county has been approved to move further into Stage 2, then hair salons and barber shops may reopen in your area. See the list of <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx">counties with a variance</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is it safe to shop at these businesses?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/">state guidelines</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can the Order be changed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue new orders as the public health situation changes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How does this order interact with local orders to shelter in place? Does it supersede them?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This is a statewide order. Counties may open additional Stage 2 sectors more quickly if they meet certain criteria.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker.For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth below).And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and <strong>do not gather with any number of people who are not members of your household.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong><strong>Are gatherings permitted?</strong></strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Gatherings—meetings or other events that bring together persons from multiple households at the same time for a shared or group experience in a single room, space, or place such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, or other indoor or outdoor space—pose an especially great danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19. As a consequence, State public health directives prohibit professional, social and community mass gatherings.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services and cultural ceremonies as well as protests. Those types of gatherings are permitted so long as they do not exceed 100 attendees or 25% of the capacity of the space in which the gathering is held, whichever is lower. All other mass gatherings are prohibited until further notice</p>



<h3 class="h2" id="political">Protected activities</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I engage in political protest?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, as explained below, although in-person protests present special public health concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19. &nbsp;Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Therefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">However, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person protests as long as (1) &nbsp;attendance is limited to 25% of the relevant area&#8217;s maximum occupancy, as defined by the relevant local permitting authority or other relevant authority, or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower, and (2) physical distancing of six feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;Face coverings are strongly recommended.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Participants must maintain a physical distance of six feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This limitation on attendance will be reviewed at least once every 21 days, beginning May 25, 2020. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I vote?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Elections are an essential activity, and the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/">Governor has issued executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible</a>. Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. The Secretary of State and the California Department of Public Health are working on additional guidance to ensure that all Californians are able to participate in elections safely. Existing laws address the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections, and those laws remain in effect unless otherwise noted.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Of course, whenever you engage in any permissible activity—including the collection and drop-off of ballots, or other election-related activities—be mindful of physical distancing and other measures to protect yourself and those around you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Can I go to church?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. As of May 25, places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship.pdf">modifications for safety (PDF)</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I practice my religious faith?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Although in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer &nbsp;began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What conditions must be met to resume religious services at places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Full information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at<a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship.pdf"> guidance for places of worship (PDF)</a>. Additionally conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity and it is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, congregants engaging in singing, particularly in the choir, and group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Places of worship must therefore limit attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. This limitation will be in effect for the first 21-days of a county public health department’s approval of religious services and cultural ceremonies activities at places of worship within their jurisdictions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">At this time, no. &nbsp;Children should remain in the care of those in their household unit and not interact with children of other parties at all times while visiting facilities. Additionally, places of worship must discontinue activities and services for children (including, for example, shared play areas) where physical distancing of at least six feet cannot be maintained.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">When will these conditions change for places of worship?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Every 21 days, the California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. This is because COVID-19 has an incubation period of 14 days; the 21-day interval accounts for this incubation period and provides for an additional seven days for thorough review, analysis, and preparation of modifications.</p>



<h3 class="h2" id="school">Schools and childcare</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">My school is providing free grab-and-go meals. Are those still available?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. It is essential to keep children fed and educated. </p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get child care during the stay home order?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, all child care facilities can open with necessary modifications. See the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/childcare/">Child care page</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can my babysitter still come to the house?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, a child care worker can come to your home if necessary and should adhere to basic prevention guidelines (e.g. handwashing for at least 20 seconds, physical distancing, staying home if feeling ill).</p>



<h3 class="h2" id="health">Health care and helping sick relatives</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I need to visit a health care provider?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#top">coronavirus symptoms</a>, please contact your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> or use the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html">Symptom Screener</a> self-checker.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator the exact symptoms you are experiencing so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What about routine, elective or non-urgent medical appointments?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Preventive care services and non-emergency surgeries, like organ replacements and tumor removals, can take place if hospitals have enough capacity and protective equipment to do so safely. Eye exams and elective procedures should be cancelled or rescheduled. If possible, health care visits should be done remotely. Dental services and preventive dental care may be resumed. Contact your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> to see what services they are providing.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get my prescriptions filled?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. You may leave your home to obtain prescription medications or cannabis from dispensaries with medical permits.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can contact your doctor through <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/">telehealth</a> to get a new prescription or adjust your existing prescriptions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I make sure the older Californians in my life are safe and healthy during the stay home order?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You should check in on your older neighbors and loved ones with a call, text or physically distanced door knock to make sure they are okay. You can also teach them how to FaceTime, Zoom, Google Duo or use Facebook video to communicate. The most important thing you can do is to keep in touch with older loved ones for their mental health and safety.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I am an older Californian who is isolating at home and I need non-urgent assistance. What can I do?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can call the statewide hotline for older Californians at <a href="tel:1-833-544-2374">833-544-2374</a> for your non-urgent medical needs, to get meals delivered, track down prescriptions and more. The most important thing you can do is stay home for your health and wellbeing. If you are experiencing an emergency please call 911.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I leave home to care for my elderly parents or friends who require assistance to care for themselves? Or a friend or family member who has disabilities?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Be sure that you protect them and yourself by following social distancing guidelines such as washing hands before and after, using hand sanitizer, maintaining at least six feet of distance when possible, and coughing or sneezing into your elbow or a tissue and then washing your hands. If you have early signs of a cold, please stay away from your older loved ones.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit loved ones in the hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing facility, or other residential care facility?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Generally no. There are limited exceptions, such as if you are going to the hospital with a minor who is under 18 or someone who is developmentally disabled and needs assistance. For most other situations, the order prohibits visitation to these kinds of facilities. This is difficult, but necessary to protect hospital staff and other patients. Check the <a href="https://www.aging.ca.gov/download.ashx?lE0rcNUV0zaaXLD5JZ%2f6Uw%3d%3d">frequently asked questions for friends and family with a loved one in a skilled nursing or residential care facility</a> for more detailed information.</p>
