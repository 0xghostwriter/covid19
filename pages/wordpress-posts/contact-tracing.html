<p>It’s time for the next step in slowing the spread of COVID-19 in California: <strong>Contact tracing</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This simple process has been used by public health for decades to slow the spread of infectious disease. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years, California has used contact tracing to help combat tuberculosis, polio, measles, HIV/AIDS, and many other infectious diseases. It works by slowing the spread and avoiding outbreaks. It will allow California to maintain our healthcare capacity and modify our Stay-at-Home order. For each person we contact, we check symptoms, offer testing, and recommend avoiding close contact with other people until it’s safe to do so.</p>



<p>The more people who participate – by answering the call &#8212; the more&nbsp;lives and jobs California saves.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Contact tracing is a simple, anonymous way to do your part.</strong></p>



<p>California is using contact tracing to identify people who get infected with COVID-19, so we can help them get medical care and figure out who they might have exposed without knowing it, so those individuals can be contacted, too. Everyone will get information on how to protect themselves and others. That’s all there is to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone receives doctor/patient confidentiality with the first call.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
