<p>Contact tracing is an important step in slowing the spread of COVID-19. It&#8217;s when health workers notify you that you&#8217;ve been in contact with an infected person, and you should also get tested. Public health departments have used contact tracing for decades to fight infectious disease. </p>



<p>Introducing <strong>California Connected</strong>, our state’s contact tracing program.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image text-center"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">

  </figure></div>



<p>Under this program, health workers will talk to those who have tested positive. They&#8217;ll alert anyone they may have exposed, keeping names confidential. They&#8217;ll check symptoms, offer testing, and discuss next steps like self-isolation and treatment.</p>



<p>By finding spread patterns quickly, we slow infection and help avoid outbreaks. This lets California keep healthcare needs below capacity and safely reopen business.</p>



<h2>All you have to do is answer a phone call</h2>



<p>Contact tracing is an anonymous way to do your part. The more people answer the call, the more lives and jobs California saves. Your information is always kept confidential.</p>



<p>Early awareness helps you protect your friends and loved ones from exposure. And early treatment can improve your outcome.</p>



<p>The sooner we can reach you, the sooner you can get advice, testing, and support.</p>



<h2>How does contact tracing work?</h2>
