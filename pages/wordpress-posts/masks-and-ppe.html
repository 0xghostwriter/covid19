<p>COVID-19 is a new disease caused by a coronavirus. The virus is thought to spread when a person who is infected with the virus speaks, sneezes, or coughs when in close (within 6 feet) contact with another person. If you are infected with the virus, you may spread the disease even if you feel well.</p>



<p>Wearing a face covering can reduce the spread of COVID-19 by limiting the release of infectious particles into the air. Wearing a face covering also reinforces physical distancing, and shows you care about the health of others.</p>



<p><strong>Public health officials now <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">require Californians to wear masks</a> or cloth face coverings in most settings outside the home. </strong>And workers in certain industries are required wear a mask or respirator while on the job. </p>



<p>So it’s important to understand the different kinds of face coverings, masks and respirators the right way to wear them.</p>



<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Face coverings do <strong>not</strong> protect the user and are <strong>not</strong> a respirator or personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>

<ul><li>Anyone going outside their home</li><li>Workers in customer-facing industries</li><li>Workers in offices, factories, or any group setting</li><li>Other workers, as dictated by <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/">industry guidance</a></li></ul>



<h3>Surgical masks:</h3>



<ul><li>Medical personnel in certain situations, such as surgery</li><li>Workers in some other industries</li></ul>



<h3>Respirators: </h3>



<ul><li>Doctors, nurses, and other health care workers caring for patients with COVID-19 and other infectious diseases</li><li>Other workers exposed to harmful air</li></ul>



<h2>Who shouldn’t wear a face covering?</h2>



<ul><li>Children under 2 years old</li><li>Anyone with respiratory issues where it would impede their breathing</li><li>Anyone unable to remove the mask without help</li><li>Workers who are required to wear a surgical mask or respirator</li></ul>

<p>You should wear a face covering whenever you’ll be around someone you don’t live with, including:</p>



<ul><li>In any indoor public space</li><li>When waiting in line</li><li>When getting health care</li><li>On public transportation or when ride-sharing</li><li>At work, when moving through common areas such as hallways</li><li>At work, when sharing common areas or a room or enclosed area with others (unless you are required to wear a surgical mask or respirator)</li><li>Outdoors, if you can’t stay at least 6 feet away from others</li></ul>

<p>There are times when it’s okay to take your face covering off, such as:</p>



<ul><li>When eating or drinking</li><li>If a hearing-impaired person needs to read your lips</li><li>If wearing a face covering imposes a risk to you at work</li><li>When you&#8217;re not sharing a common area, room or enclosed place with others</li><li>At work, when at your desk or work station if it is not accessible to the public and you can maintain at least six feet of distance from others at all times</li><li>When you are getting a service to the nose or face</li><li>When outdoors in public and can stay six feet from others who are not members of your household</li></ul>



<p>You should replace the face covering as soon as you can after these activities to reduce risk of infection.</p>



<p><strong>Note: Face coverings remain strongly encouraged even when not required.</strong></p>



<h2>Kinds of face coverings, masks, and respirators</h2>



<p>There are many kinds of face coverings, masks, and respirators. See this <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/Face-coverings-poster.pdf">chart</a> for a summary.</p>



<h3>Cloth face covering</h3>



<p>This is cloth used to cover the nose and mouth, that is tied behind the head, secured to the head with elastic straps, or secured over the ears with elastic loops. It is made of cotton, silk, linen, or neoprene, and can be machine-made or hand-sewn. A homemade version can be improvised from a scarf or t-shirt. They should be made of a tightly woven fabric. Face coverings made of loosely woven fabric will not protect people around the user.</p>



<p>Most people should wear a cloth face covering. This is so there can be enough surgical masks and N95 respirators for medical personnel.</p>



<p><strong>Wearing a cloth face covering doesn’t take the place of physical distancing.</strong> It is effective when combined with keeping a 6-foot distance from others.</p>



<p><strong>Use and care: </strong>Wear a clean mask every time you go out. Wash in the laundry or by hand between uses. See more instructions from the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf">California Department of Public Health</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Where to find: </strong>Many online sellers now offer masks in a variety of materials. You can also make your own. Read how in this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">cloth mask guidance from the CDC</a>.</p>



<h3>Surgical mask</h3>



<p>This is a manufactured disposable mask, often used in surgery. </p>



<p><strong>Don’t buy surgical masks for personal use.</strong> They are part of PPE needed by medical professionals and other workers.</p>



<p>Medical personnel wear surgical masks for protection against fluid splashes. They are also worn by healthcare workers as source control to protect patients and co-workers near the health care worker from infectious aerosols possibly emitted by the wearer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In extreme respirator shortage situations, health care workers may also wear surgical masks if respirators cannot be obtained by the employer. Surgical masks do not provide adequate protection to health care workers who work with patients who have or are suspected to have COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Surgical masks may also be used by other kinds of workers when protection from fluids is needed or when it’s important to use a disposable mask (e.g., in food processing).</p>



<p><strong>Use and care:</strong> Start with a new mask every day. Replace and dispose of it according to your workplace guidelines.</p>



<p><strong>Where to find: </strong>If you are in one of the above industries, your employer should provide surgical masks at work if they are needed as PPE. If you’re a frontline employer and need to order them for your workers, see how to <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/request-ppe/">Request PPE</a>.</p>



<p>Don’t buy surgical masks for personal use.&nbsp;They are part of PPE needed by medical professionals and other workers.</p>



<h3>N95 respirator</h3>



<p>This is a respirator that blocks 95% of particles that are otherwise inhaled. When properly fit tested, N95 respirators protect the user from inhaling particles that cause infectious diseases like COVID-19. Medical personnel need them the most, but they&#8217;re used by some workers in other industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Use and care:</strong> Start with a new respirator every day. Replace and dispose of it according to your workplace guidelines.</p>



<p><strong>Where to find: </strong>If an N95 respirator is required for your job, your employer must provide them at work. If you’re a frontline employer who needs N95 respirator for your workers, see how to <a href="http://covid19.ca.gov/request-ppe/">Request PPE</a>.</p>



<p>Don’t buy N95 respirator for personal use.&nbsp;They are part of PPE needed by medical professionals and other workers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Other types of respirators</h3>



<p>There are many other types of respirators that protect the user from harmful air. They include:</p>



<p><strong>Powered air-purifying respirators, </strong>which have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters to provide clean air to the user.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Elastomeric respirators</strong> are reusable respirators with a rubbery facepiece that is cleaned, disinfected, and reused. This respirator type uses replaceable filter cartridges.</p>
