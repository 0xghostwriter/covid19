<h2><strong>PPE request and distribution process</strong></h2>



<p>Cal OES and the Department of Public Health distribute masks and cloth facial coverings as part of a far-reaching effort to support medical personnel and Californians working on the front lines to re-open economic activity in our state while continuing to limit spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>



<p>The priority of the state remains ensuring the safety of critical healthcare workers and Californians working on the front lines of the response to COVID-19.</p>



<p>To date, the state has delivered tens of millions of masks and other pieces of <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19CountyProfile/COVID-19CountyProfile?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=no&amp;:showVizHome=no">life saving personal protective equipment to counties</a> and counties.</p>



<p>The information below outlines who needs a mask, how to preserve existing masks and how those in front-line industries can go about ordering more in emergency situations.</p>



<h2><strong>Who needs a mask?</strong></h2>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/General-Industry.html">Cal OSHA</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html">CDC</a> recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.</p>



<p>Health officials also advises the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.&nbsp; Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.</p>



<p>Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.</p>



<p>The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.&nbsp; Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</p>

<h2><strong>Preservation strategies for masks and other PPE</strong></h2>



<p>If PPE <strong>is</strong> required by law or regulation as part of routine duties performed by essential critical infrastructure workers:</p>



<ul><li>Extend use times of undamaged, non-visibly soiled PPE, and implement expanded facility-based PPE reuse policies and procedures.</li><li>Adapt and implement Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strategies for healthcare to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/index.html">optimize the supply of PPE</a> and equipment, and <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1587131519031-6501ee8a0ce72004832fa37141c53bc0/PPE_FACTSHEET.pdf">best practices</a> to sustain PPE supplies.</li><li>Implement <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/decontamination-reuse-respirators.html">decontamination and reuse strategies</a> of filtering facepiece respirators as contingency and crisis capacity measures.</li><li>Understand and track PPE requirements and burn rates. Utilize CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/burn-calculator.html">PPE burn rate calculator</a> if you lack an existing means to do so.</li><li>Use alternative types or sources of PPE to support necessary operations. Use National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respiratory protection that was not previously approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Monitor FDA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) websites for updates and announcements on relaxed enforcement and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization">Emergency Use Authorizations</a>.</li><li>Consult <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/conserving-respirator-supply.html">guidance</a> from CDC’s NIOSH on strategies to conserve, extend and respond to shortages in the supply of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) used in non-healthcare worksites, such as manufacturing and construction.</li></ul>



<p>If PPE <strong>is not</strong> required by law or regulation as part of routine duties performed by essential critical infrastructure workers:</p>



<ul><li>Implement exposure-reduction measures, such as barrier controls (e.g., Plexiglass barriers, improved ventilation systems) and safe-work practices, such as adjusting business operations to increase physical space between employees. Consult CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fguidance-business-response.html">Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to COVID-19</a> for further considerations to reduce overall risk of exposure in the workplace.</li><li>Do not attempt to acquire medical or industrial use PPE for such employees. Such PPE is likely unavailable and is required for other higher priority critical infrastructure functions. Surgical masks or N95 respirators are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</li><li>Instead, follow CDC guidance on use of simple cloth face coverings. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html">CDC recommends</a> wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., control rooms, production floors), especiallyin areas of significant community-based transmission.&nbsp;</li><li>If commercially sourced cloth face coverings are not available, they can be fashioned from common materials at low cost. Follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">CDC’s guidance</a> on how to make and use of cloth face coverings.</li></ul>



<p>All industries should follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/critical-workers/implementing-safety-practices.html">government guidance</a> to help the most critical workers quickly return to work after potential exposure to someone with COVID-19, provided those workers are symptom-free.</p>



<h2><strong>Acquiring PPE during shortages</strong></h2>



<p>If after minimizing the need for PPE through strategies described above, PPE is still required by <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce">essential critical infrastructure workers</a> to perform their duties, organizations should:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Continue working with normal and alternate private sector suppliers to obtain PPE. It may be necessary to identify multiple options for suppliers and prioritize near-term versus long-term needs.</li><li>If suppliers are unable to provide for your needs, and the PPE is urgently required, submit a request for assistance to your local <a href="https://emsa.ca.gov/medical-health-operational-area-coordinator/">Medical Health Operational Area Coordinator</a> or county emergency management agency. If local emergency management is unable to address the PPE shortfall, they can relay it to the State Operations Center. If the state is unable to address it, they can submit a request for support to their FEMA Regional Response Coordination Center.</li></ol>



<p>The process for ordering masks and other supplies from the state works as follows:</p>

<h3>Employer level</h3>



<p>The first priority of employers in critical infrastructure sectors is to ensure that the employees and people they serve have access to the protective masks and other PPE necessary to safely perform their duties. The employer has primary responsibility for the procurement and distribution of emergency PPE. When the employer’s ability to procure and distribute masks is insufficient to meet the demand or exceeds, or is anticipated to exceed the employer’s ability to do so, they should contact their county or operational area.</p>



<h3>Local government/county level</h3>



<p>The first priority of the City/County or Special District is to ensure the people they serve have access to PPE while performing critical functions to slow the spread of COVID-19 and begin reopening the economy. The local government is responsible for the procurement and distribution of emergency PPE within their jurisdiction. When the demand for procuring and distributing emergency PPE exceeds or is anticipated to exceed its ability to do so, the local government/special district should contact the regional emergency operations center.</p>



<h3>Regional level</h3>



<p>When the demand for procuring and distributing emergency PPE exceeds or is anticipated to exceed its ability to do so, the region will contact the State for assistance.</p>



<h3>State level</h3>



<p>Cal OES will coordinate to provide support and PPE resources to field level operations. If the emergency response requires resources beyond the capability of the State, Cal OES may request resources from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), public/private partnerships, or other sources.</p>
