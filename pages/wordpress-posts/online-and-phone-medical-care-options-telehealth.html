<p>During this coronavirus outbreak, the safest way to get medical care is by phone or online while staying at home. This is called “telehealth.”</p>



<p>Telehealth is the safest way to get care for symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>



<p>If you have <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#top">coronavirus symptoms</a> and think you need <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/#top">testing or treatment</a>, call your health care provider. Many health care providers and health plans offer telehealth options for COVID-19 screening.</p>



<p>If you’re having a medical emergency, you should still call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.</p>



<p>Telehealth is also the best way to get most other medical care including treatment for symptoms of other conditions, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, and for follow-up visits to treat ongoing conditions during the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/#top">Stay Home Order</a>. California has <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/17/california-requests-federal-government-waiver-to-cover-medi-cal-recipients-and-expand-tele-health-options/">relaxed certain rules</a> so you can get care through telehealth while you’re at home.</p>



<p><strong>The simplest way to get treated over the phone is to call your regular health care provider.</strong> If you don’t have a doctor, your doctor is too busy, or your doctor can’t treat you by phone or video, your health plan may offer other telehealth options. Nurse advice lines, health plan patient portals, and member websites are several ways to get telehealth.</p>



<p>You should not have to pay more than you would for an in-person visit if you receive care through telehealth. Some health plans may waive any copay, but check with both your health plan and provider first about their policies.</p>



<p>If you have trouble accessing your regular health care provider through phone or telehealth, here’s what you can do:</p>



<p>For private health plans, call the state Department of Managed Health Care’s Help Center at 1-888-466-2219. </p>



<p>For Medi-Cal, call the state Department of Health Care Service’s Help Center at 1-800-541-5555.</p>
