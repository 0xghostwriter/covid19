<p>During this coronavirus outbreak, the safest way to get medical care is by phone or online while staying at home. This is called “telehealth.”</p>



<p>Telehealth is the safest way to get care for symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>



<p>If you have <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#top">coronavirus symptoms</a> and think you need <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/#top">testing or treatment</a>, call your health care provider. Many health care providers and health plans offer telehealth options for COVID-19 screening.</p>



<p>If you’re having a medical emergency, you should still call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.</p>



<p>Telehealth is also the best way to get most other medical care including treatment for symptoms of other conditions, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, and for follow-up visits to treat ongoing conditions during the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/#top">Stay Home Order</a>. California has <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/17/california-requests-federal-government-waiver-to-cover-medi-cal-recipients-and-expand-tele-health-options/">relaxed certain rules</a> so you can get care through telehealth while you’re at home.</p>



<p>You should not have to pay more for telehealth than you would for an in-person visit. Some health plans or providers may even waive any copay.</p>



<p><strong>How to get telehealth:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>The simplest way to get treated over the phone is to call your regular health care provider.</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>If your doctor isn’t available, your health plan may offer other telehealth options through their&nbsp;member websites. If telehealth isn&#8217;t available from your doctor or your health plan, you can consult nurse advice lines.</li></ul>



<p>If you have a hearing or speech disability, you can dial 711 to be connected to a free telecommunications relay service which can be used with a text telephone (TTY) or other device.  </p>



<p>If you have trouble accessing your regular health care provider through phone or telehealth, here’s what you can do:</p>



<p>For private health plans, call the state Department of Managed Health Care’s Help Center at 1-888-466-2219.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Medi-Cal, call the state Department of Health Care Service’s Help Center at 1-800-541-5555.</p>
