<p>As part of the administration’s commitment to transparency, this page provides the public with access to contracts valued at over $250,000 that have been entered into as part of the state’s response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this page is to allow Californians to monitor state spending and know where their tax dollars are going.</p>



<p>This page will be updated frequently as additional contracts become available and is meant to include significant high-value contracts that may be of interest to the public. It is not meant to be a full accounting of ALL state expenditures.For more detailed information on state spending, you are encouraged to visit California&#8217;s financial transparency portal <a href="https://open.fiscal.ca.gov/">Open FI$Cal</a> which displays data from the Financial Information System for California (FI$Cal).</p>
