<p>Californians have been staying home and saving lives since the start of our statewide stay-at-home order issued on March 19, 2020. These efforts have allowed the state to move forward on our <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/update-on-california-pandemic-roadmap.pdf">roadmap</a> for modifying the statewide order. </p>

<p>We are now moving into <strong>Stage 2, </strong>where some lower-risk workplaces can gradually open with adaptations. The state is issuing guidance to help these workplaces reopen safely.</p>

<h2>Industry guidance to reduce the risk</h2>

<p>California will move into Stage 2 of modifying the state’s Stay-at-Home order on May 8, 2020. Our progress in achieving key <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/ygo/7rmtb/tbgtmyuzjanmc/8t71/8l9ety77/5hq/2tbncv">public health metrics</a> will allow a gradual re-opening of California’s economy.</p>

<p>We recognize the impact of economic hardship. We must get our economy roaring once again and put paychecks in people’s pockets. But the risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal.</p>

<p>That is why every business must take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plan and prepare for re-opening</li>
  <li>Make radical changes within the workplace</li>
  <li>Adjust practices by employees and help educate customers</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is guidance for each early Stage 2 business to follow. The goal is a safe, clean environment for workers and customers. Businesses may use effective alternative or innovative methods to build upon the guidelines.</p>

<p>Review the guidance that&#8217;s relevant to your workplace, prepare a plan based on the guidance, and put it into action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
  <em>When complete, you can post </em>
  <strong>
    <em>this checklist</em>
  </strong>
  <em> in your workplace to show your customers and your employees that you&#8217;ve reduced the risk and open for business.</em>
</p>

<p>Before, reopening, all facilities <strong>must:</strong>
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Perform a detailed risk assessment and implement a site-specific protection plan</li>
  <li>Train employees on how to limit the spread of COVID-19, including how to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?cdc_aa_refval=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cdc.gov%2fcoronavirus%2f2019-ncov%2fsymptoms-testing%2findex.html">screen themselves for symptoms</a> and stay home if they have them</li>
  <li>Implement individual control measures and screenings</li>
  <li>Implement disinfecting protocols</li>
  <li>Implement physical distancing guidelines</li>
</ol>

<h2>Customers and individuals</h2>

<p>Customers and individuals are encouraged to stay home if they have a fever or other coronavirus symptoms. Those with symptoms or elevated temperatures should not shop, get services in person, go to work or congregate with others. If you’re not sure if this applies to you, check your symptoms with this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?cdc_aa_refval=https%3a%2f%2fwww.cdc.gov%2fcoronavirus%2f2019-ncov%2fsymptoms-testing%2findex.html">Symptom Screener</a>.</p>

<p>Higher risk individuals should continue to stay home until Stage 4.</p>

<h2>
  <strong>Workplace steps to reopening</strong>
</h2>

<p>Before opening, all facilities <strong>must</strong> first perform a detailed risk assessment and implement a site-specific protection plan. Adaptations need to be made before Stage 2 workplaces can open – currently that includes modifications like curbside pickup at retail locations. </p>
