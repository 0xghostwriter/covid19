# covid19
The new website, COVID19.CA.gov, is designed to answer the questions people have and present information that is real time and actionable. It provides a single source of  truth for people looking for information about COVID-19 developments and response here in California. As well as a centralized location for simplified policy guidance. It is intended to be simple to understand while providing links back to department websites.

As the situation develops, the website will be updated in real time with information as it becomes available.
